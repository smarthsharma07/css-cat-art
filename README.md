## CSS Cat Art 🐱

A pure HTML + CSS illustration of a cat face.
No images, no SVGs, no canvas.

### What I practiced
- CSS positioning & stacking
- Border-radius based shapes
- Pseudo-elements (::before, ::after)
- Layering with z-index
- Visual composition using basic CSS only

### Why this exists
Built as a practice project to strengthen CSS fundamentals
before moving into larger UI and frontend projects.
